# Get-Things-Done-Planner
A user using this daily planner to create a schedule for their work day. When a user opens the planner the current
day is displayed at the top of the calendar, and when a user scrolls down then they are presented with timeblocks 
for standard business hours. A user can view the timeblocks for that day, and each timeblock is color coded to 
indicate whether it is in the past, present, or future. When a user clicks into a timeblock they can enter an 
event, and when the user clicks the save button for that timeblock the text for that event is saved in local storage.
